# Docker Commands
The `docker run` command is a combination of the `pull` and `start` command. `docker pull` downloads a image from your image repository. The default is [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com). `docker images` shows you your downloaded images on your system. `docker start` starts your container. With `docker ps` you can see your running containers. For non running containers you need to to run `docker ps -a`. `docker run -it` gives you an interactive shell into your container. `docker attach <running_container_name>` provides you access to a running container. To exit your container you type `exit` in the shell.
